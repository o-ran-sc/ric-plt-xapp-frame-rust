      "message": "Since This is an initial release and only client side functionality, not added any new test cases for alarms. If you are okay with this, please +1 this change. \n\nMore than Unit tests, I believe it\u0027s a better idea to add integration tests with mock replies for subscriptions, registrations and alarms. That would be a better test for the framework (almost mimicking the actual App functionality). But that can be added as a separate task. This is an involved but useful effort but can be taken up in next release.",
